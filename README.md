I'm glad to share with you my first project on atmega32 (MCU) interfacing
the project is an advanced calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations
the calculator Features:
1- Support math procedures 
2- Support negative result
3- Support floating result
4- The user can perform many calculations at the same time

The calculator is implemented using the following components:

-atmega32 Microcontroller
- LM016L 2x16(LCD)
- Keypad (4x4)

-The Software is written in C language
- I have used a significant type of software architecture called (Layered Architecture)

- I wrote and used the following:
- 
  1-DIO Driver
  2-LCD Driver
  3-Keypad Driver
  
  you can read each driver_interface.h & config.h to understand how to use driver
  If you find any bugs, feel free to contact me
